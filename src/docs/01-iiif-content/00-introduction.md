# Introduction

IIIF content is the core of the content in the platform.

IIIF Collections, Manifests and Canvases are imported and enriched in the Madoc platform. They are shallow copies of original IIIF content and can be customised to suit the presentation of different websites. In this section of the documentation we go into how to populate the platform with IIIF content, how to edit that content and how to search and organise that content.
