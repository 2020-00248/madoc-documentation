# Site pages

Using Omeka, you can create custom site pages and augment them with IIIF content.

## Creating a new page

To create a new page you first need to select your site in the admin panel. Choose the pages menu item on the left hand side<sup>(1)</sup>. Now you can click "Add new page" in the top right to create your page.<sup>(2)</sup>

## Adding custom blocks

Once you give your page a title, a path that it will be available on the website and choose if it is in the navigation bar, you will be taken to a page builder. This is where you can add custom page blocks to build up the content of the page. Down the right hand side you will see standard omeka items<sup>(1)</sup> and the Madoc platforms own additions, mostly relating to IIIF content. <sup>(2)</sup>

Click on one of the blocks and fill out the form that appears. You can create as many blocks as you want to build up your page. Once you are finished, click "Save" in the top right.<sup>(3)</sup>
