# Introduction

Omeka pages can be customised with IIIF content, our IIIF pages can be customised with Omeka content.

There are some out of the box plugins that Omeka provides, and some custom functionality that we have added to showcase specific IIIF content.

The 2 ways of adding content to pages are:
* [Site pages](/customising-pages/site-pages) - normal Omeka pages, built up using page blocks
* [IIIF Pages](/customising-pages/iiif-pages) - custom pages added by our system, with custom media attached

The latter, added by us, are represented not as pages in the website, but as Items in Omeka. The pages themselves will be built up programatically using the attached [Media](/customising-pages/reference).
