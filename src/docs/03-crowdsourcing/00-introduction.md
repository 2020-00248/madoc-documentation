# Introduction

A Quick introduction to our annotation features, technology and motivation.

The Madoc crowdsourcing section of the platform is comprised of 3 steps
* Describing a UI that can be shown to users to create annotations
* Describing the format of the annotations created
* Interacting with the Annotation creation UI

The first 2 steps are implemented together in our [Capture Models](/crowdsourcing/capture-models). The last is done with our Annotation studio, which accepts capture models and allows the creation of the described annotations.
