# Capture models

A capture model is a JSON-LD document that describes both the UI for creating an annotation and the structure that the annotation should look like. It can also structure a choice of capture models, that will be shown in the annotation UI.

## Importing capture models

From the admin menu, down at the bottom there is an option "Capture model importer". You can click on this, choose a JSON file from your computer and then choose a site to assign the model to. Once you click save your capture model will be imported and added to the selected site. You can always add this to multiple sites by adding it to the [site pool](/multisite/creating-new-site#adding-site-content).

## Choices

You can add multiple capture models and create a choice between them. This will show and allow the user to drill in to which choice they want. These choices can be as deep as required. You can also reuse the same capture models for the leaves of the choices.
